# SADX-cutscene-decompilation
This is a decompilation of all 206 event scripts in SADX.

Compiling is very slow due to the number of large files involved.
It's highly recommended that you remove any event files you don't use if making a mod using this to improve build time and prevent conflict with other mods.
